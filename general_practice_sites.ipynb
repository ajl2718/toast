    "**Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is difficult to find existing datasets for general practice locations in Australia (e.g., from data.gov.au or data.vic.gov.au). Healthdirect appears to be the best official source of health provider locations. \n",
    "\n",
    "This scraper contains some basic code to scrape healthdirect.gov.au to get the names and locations of all General Practice sites in Victoria. It can be modified to obtain all those in any other given state, the whole country or just a subset of postcodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions**\n",
    "- Make sure that pandas, requests and lxml are installed\n",
    "- Ensure that the reference postcode data is specified correctly\n",
    "- Run each of the cells in order. "
